# Roox
Roox is a Rukovoditel plugin that gives additional features to your application for some specific purposes. 

Roox modules can be installed separately via module installer, with or without interdependency.

This repository only contains module core for the base of other modules.

How to install:
* Create a folder "roox" in folder plugins of your Rukovoditel installation.
* Open and login to your Rukovoditel. The module will automatically install some required tables (with prefix 'roox') in your Rukovoditel database.
* You will immediately see Roox in the sidebar menu.
